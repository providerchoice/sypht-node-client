# Sypht Nodejs Client
This repository is a Nodejs reference client implementation for working with the Sypht API at https://api.sypht.com.

## About Sypht
[Sypht](https://sypht.com) is a SaaS [API]((https://docs.sypht.com/)) which extracts key fields from documents. For 
example, you can upload an image or pdf of a bill or invoice and extract the amount due, due date, invoice number 
and biller information. 

### Getting started
To get started you'll need API credentials, i.e. a `client_id` and `client_secret`, which can be obtained by registering
for an [account](https://www.sypht.com/signup/developer)

### Prerequisites
* Node.js version 8+.

### Installation
WIP

### Usage
Populate system environment variable with the credentials generated above:

```Bash
SYPHT_API_KEY="$client_id:$client_secret"
```

then invoke the client with a file of your choice:
```javascript
var arr = utils.processAPIKey(process.env.SYPHT_API_KEY);
var sypht = new Sypht({
    clientId : arr[0],
    clientSecret : arr[1],
});
var data = await sypht.fileUpload([INVOICE, DOCUMENT], fs.createReadStream('./sample_invoice.pdf'), 'sample_invoice.pdf');
data = await sypht.fetchResults(data['fileId']);
console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
```
